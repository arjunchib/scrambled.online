# Bacon

## Steps
1. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil or parchment paper, and lay out as many bacon strips as will fit snuggly without overlapping.
2. Place in a cold oven. Then heat the oven to 400Â° F and bake to desired crispness, 25 to 35 minutes.
3. Drain well on a paper-towel-lined platter.
